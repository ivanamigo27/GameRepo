# GameRepo

Couldn't configure it to work along with Unity, so just uploaded here the final project


Also had problems uploading the "Library" folder because GitHub doesn't allow me to upload files larger than 25mb so there are some things that are in zip and have to be decompressed when you download it. The files are:

Inside the "Library" folder :
    
   ArtifactDB.zip
   SourceAssetDB.zip

Inside "Library/PackageCache" :
    
   Everything inside the folder
